Project Overview
This project is a basic implementation of a web application that uses MongoDB as the database. It includes CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and demonstrates how to integrate MongoDB into a Node.js/Express environment.

Technologies Used
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
Express: Web framework for Node.js.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
(Optional): React or any frontend technology depending on your stack.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js
MongoDB (or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-hosted database)
You can check if Node.js is installed by running:

bash
Copy code
node -v
If MongoDB is installed locally, check by running:

bash
Copy code
mongod --version
Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mongodb-project.git
cd mongodb-project
Install dependencies:
Install the required Node.js packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure MongoDB:
If you're using a local MongoDB instance, make sure MongoDB is running.

For a cloud-based MongoDB (e.g., MongoDB Atlas), you'll need to create a cluster and get your connection URI.

Create a .env file:
In the root of the project, create a .env file to store sensitive environment variables like your MongoDB connection string:

env
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
Replace mydatabase with the name of your database.

Run the project:
Start the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port you've configured).

Usage
After setting up the project, you can interact with the API endpoints defined in the server.js or app.js (depending on your structure).

Example CRUD Operations
Create: POST /api/items
Read: GET /api/items
Update: PUT /api/items/:id
Delete: DELETE /api/items/:id
Refer to the API documentation or inspect the routes in routes/ and the MongoDB schema in models/ to see how CRUD operations are set up.
